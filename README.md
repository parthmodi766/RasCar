Project Definition:
RasCar is an electrically powered model car. It can drive itself autonomously in the dark and in adverse whether conditions. In the two months duration of the project our team of two engineers worked on developing a python script to interface all the different components. of the project and also assembled all the sensors and actuators on a metal chassis. My focus was on both hardware and software development.

The Goal:
To create a simple model of an autonomous car with features like object dedtection, automatic headlights, and automatic wipers.

Components Used:
Raspberry Pi 3B,
Infrared Sensor modules,
Rain drop sensor,
Metal chassis,
Light Dependent Resistor,
Motors.
